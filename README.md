JSLT - JSON transformations, revisited
======================================

This code is originally from Cyril Jandia, copied from jsfiddle at https://jsfiddle.net/c7usrpsL/12/

So far (first commit) I've just slightly modified it to run with node instead of in a browser.

The goal is to write JSON-to-JSON or JSON-to-whatever transformations in Javascript, a bit like
XSLT.
